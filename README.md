Weather Aggregator API üå§Ô∏è
A robust Flask-based weather service that aggregates data from multiple weather providers to deliver accurate and reliable weather information. Features caching, rate limiting, and comprehensive API documentation.
This Project is done by LIKULEASH +91 94892 84767 

üåü Features
1. Multi-Provider Aggregation: Combines data from OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI for enhanced accuracy
2. Smart Caching: TTL-based caching to reduce external API calls and improve performance
3. Rate Limiting: Built-in protection against API abuse with configurable limits
4. RESTful API: Clean, well-documented endpoints following REST principles
5. Swagger Documentation: Interactive API documentation with automatic UI generation
6. Geocoding Support: Location search and validation
7. Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful response codes
8. Production Ready: Environment-based configuration and logging

üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Provider Aggregation
The service intelligently combines data from multiple providers:
Numeric values (temperature, humidity): Averaged across providers
Weather conditions: Most frequent condition is selected
Fallback handling: Continues working if one provider fails

üöÄ Deployment
Development

bash
python app.py
Production with Gunicorn
bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
